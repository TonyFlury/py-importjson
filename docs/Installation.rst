Installation
============

Installation is very simple :

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install py-importjson

There is no further configuration or setup required - by default the library can now be used in your python application.

To start using the `importjson` library in your python code - simply import the library before you try to import your json file

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import importjson

You can now import json files - as described in :doc:`GettingStarted`, and :doc:`Specification`

Once imported (and before you import json files) there are some configurations you can change to change how the imports work - see :ref:`module-configuration` for more details. These configurations are optional.
